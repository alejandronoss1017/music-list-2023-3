# üî© What's a Back-end?

As we are building a web application, we need to have a back-end and a front-end. The back-end is the part of the application that is responsible for the business logic and the front-end is the part that is responsible for the user interface.

# ü§î How it works?

We are using **Spring boot** to build our back-end. Spring boot is a framework that helps us to build web applications. It is based on the Spring framework, which is a framework that helps us to build enterprise applications. Spring boot use a **MVC architecture**, which means that we have a model, a view and a controller, but we are not using the view part, because we are building a **REST API**, so we don't need to render any **HTML** pages, instead we return **JSON** objects that are consumed by the front-end.

## üéÆ Controllers

The controllers are the part of the application that is responsible for receiving the requests from the front-end and returning the responses. The controllers are the entry point of the application. The controllers are annotated with `@RestController` and the methods are annotated with `@RequestMapping` to specify the path of the endpoint and the **HTTP** method that the endpoint accepts and `@Autowired` to inject the dependencies.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/myEndpoint")
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    /* Methods to handle different types of request */
}
```

## üè™ Services

The services are the part of the application that is responsible for the business logic. The services are annotated with `@Service` and the methods are annotated with `@Transactional` to specify that the method is a transaction and `@Autowired` to inject the dependencies.

```java
@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private MyRepository myRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void myMethod() {
        /* Business logic */
    }
}
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Repositories

The repositories are the part of the application that is responsible for the communication with the database. The repositories are annotated with `@Repository` and they extend the `CrudRepository` interface.

```java
@Repository
public interface MyRepository extends CrudRepository<MyModel, Long> {
    /* Methods to query the database */
}
```

## ü¶¥ Models

The models are the part of the application that is responsible for the data. The models are annotated with `@Entity` and they are mapped to a table in the database. The models are also annotated with `@Data` to generate the getters and setters.

```java

@Entity
@Data
public class MyModel {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    /* Other Attributes */
}
```

# üíΩ Database

We are using **MySQL** as our database. We are using **MySQL Workbench** to visualize and design the database, also with **Spring boot** we are generate the database schema from our models. We implemented some **triggers** and **stored procedures** to handle some logic directly in the database. Finally we deployed the database in **AWS RDS**.
